## Getting Started

### 1. Fork the Repository
Click the **Fork** button on the top-right corner of this repository to create a copy under your GitHub account.

### 2. Clone the Repository
Clone your forked repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/minorcell/hub-io.git
cd hub-io
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fix Bugs or Implement Features
- Check the [Issues](https://github.com/minorcell/hub-io/issues) page for tasks labeled `help wanted` or `good first issue`.
- If you want to implement a new feature, please open an Issue first to discuss its feasibility with the maintainers.

### 2. Write Tests
Ensure that you write unit tests or integration tests for your code. Test coverage is crucial for maintaining the stability of the project.

### 3. Update Documentation
If you modify the code, make sure to update relevant documentation (e.g., README, API docs).

## Code Style Guidelines

To maintain consistency across the codebase, please follow these guidelines:

### TypeScript
- Use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to format your code.
- Follow the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) for TypeScript.
- Run the linter to ensure your code adheres to the style guide:
  ```bash
  npm run lint   # or yarn lint
  ```

### TailwindCSS
- Follow the [TailwindCSS Best Practices](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first).
- Avoid writing custom CSS unless absolutely necessary. Use Tailwind's utility classes instead.

### Markdown
- Use clear heading levels (`#`, `##`, `###`).
- Keep lists, links, and code blocks consistent.
